My mom had a very serious disease and so he did the heavy-lifting out of necessity but then it just became their pattern.  My parents have been happily married for 30+ years and my dad definitely set the bar high.    \nMy bf is amazing and does lots of things for me but I realise I can allow him to pick up more chores than is really fair.  We had arguments about it at first because it took me some time to see that he was really in the right and I was in the wrong, and he was unfairly picking up after me and doing the majority of the chores.  I haven't completely changed my ways but I'm actively trying and I even if I \"lapse\" I have the awareness to at least thank him for being so attentive & for loving me and caring for me.  My awareness has changed our dynamic for the better so I would encourage you to continue talking to your girlfriend.  The secret is you have to talk to her in a loving way. Bring this up when you both are in a great place laughing and enjoying each other.  Don't wait until you're feeling bitter or resentful because you will just come across as wrong and she won't understand your perspective.  \nSomething else that helped me was us deciding to relegate certain chores to each other.  For example, he does nearly 100% of the dishes (I am very lazy about dishes and can let them pile up and then he nags me, I get mad, etc.) but I do 100% of the toilet, sink, & bathtub cleaning (which I tend to stay on top of because I don't like messy bathrooms).  I also do 90% of the cooking because I love to make meals for us.  This has helped because then my focus is less on all of the things that need to get done that overwhelm me and more just on \"my\" duties.  Good luck.",

You can explain to them why that hurts, and they'll likely understand how you feel, but you still can't force them to care and put work into the relationship. And I've stopped being angry at them for it, they probably are focused on other things in their lives, maybe they're depressed or busy or whatever reasons they have, those reasons aren't actually my business, and its up to me to enforce a boundary that I have, in that I won't dump energy into a dying relationship.

Hair Mineral tests are the best for these things, and include a long period of data with other complementary compounds that can worsen deficiencies.\n\nThe way I usually do it with clients is through questionnaires, regarding things like eye and body twitches, cramps, anxiety, insomnia, low energy and mood, poor digestion, consistently cold hands and feet, and very importantly: diets. \n\nThose lifestyle questions help me see what they eat (is it low in minerals, or full of heavy carbs that need magnesium to digest, or full of phytic acid/oxalates that prevent mineral absorption) and if they\u2019re under heavy stress, low sleep, or exercise without replenishing electrolytes (potassium is also needed for magnesium to function) which all dumps even more magnesium and leads to even heavier stress/anxiety which dumps even more and so on so on the terrible cycle goes.\n\nSeveral meta-studies have shown that American soil is heavily depleted from over-farming and glyphosate that chelates minerals , so I almost **always** start them on magnesium and zinc biglycinate, then Vitamin D3 if their labs show a less than optimal amount, and then an adaptogenic herb like Panax Ginseng, Rhodiola, Shilajit etc. to rebalance the HPA axis that chronic stress and bad sleep set off kilter.\n\nI still believe the best way to do it is try it out (it\u2019s extremely safe and benign unless one has bad kidney issues), and I\u2019d say 95% of the time they react beautifully and maintain use long after we\u2019re finished working together :)",

Bibulus was one of the worst politicians to ever grace this planet, and it really showed. As a conservative, he tried to prevent Caesar's radical reforms from being passed throughout the year, starting by vetoing a land reform bill meant to reduce the number of urban poor within Rome. When he showed up to do just that (with an entourage of political allies and his lictors, roman bodyguards), the plebian crowd lunged forward, overpowered his bodyguards, and then dumped feces on him. After that event Bibulus stopped going out in public and simply tried to obstruct Caesar by declaring public holidays or that he sensed bad omens on days when Caesar had scheduled important Senate meetings (to have them canceled), as well as preventing Caesar from holding the elections for next year's officials for months. At the end of his term as Consul, Bibulus was entitled to give a speech to a crowd, but a gangster Plebian Tribune vetoed him from doing it. Romans named their years after who was in charge (for example, the year 55 BCE was known to them as the year of Pompey & Crassus), but because Bibulus was basically absent for the entire year people simply called it \"the year of Julius & Caesar\". I can't believe Bibulus was a real person but I'm really glad he was.\n\nP.S. Pretty sure his name means something like \"drunk\".\n\nWoah, you're a pilot? That is so cool!

An entirely different question I have is why do people take these loans if they don't know that they can pay it back later? I'm not American so this is a geniuine question, I'm not familiar with this culture. If you want to go to engineering school and go into debt to do so, you will probably be able to pay the debt when you're an engineer. However if you study something that's rather niche you might not be able to find a good job immediately. Do American colleges cost a different amount based on the department? Do engineering schools cost more than, say, arts or humanities?",
    "output": "1. If you dont pay debt it accumulated interest and very, very negatively effects your credit score for more than ten years. No loans or credit cards or apartments for you (at least without a cosigner, if you can find one). \n\n2. There are very very few Americans who can afford college with out loans. There is a large rhetoric in American society that college is the only way to make money, and you have to spend money to make money. Children are mislead by adults. Do you think at 17 I really knew what a psychology major stood to make with only a bachelors degree? No it wasnt until I was out and in the field that I realized that degree alone would take quite some time to make back my money from a private university I was led to choose by my parents over cheaper universities because it was closer. Others have their reason for which they choose, that was mine. I could have transferred during the four years when I realized this, but then I ran the risk of more money spent on an extra year or semester if credits didnt transfer. \n\n3. Different colleges cost different amounts depending on lots of factors. Generally there is not much of a system to it other than private schools cost more than public state schools. It's not based on subject at all. Except that obviously certain fields require more specialized schooling or longer."

Take one stick of butter and cut it up into small little pieces and just put the pieces on top of the cake mix.  Stick it in an oven at 350 for for 45-60 minutes. I like to sprinkle a little bit of extra sugar on top when it is almost done so the sugar gets nice and caramalized. \n\nYou can pair any canned fruit with any flavor of cake. One that I don't like because I don't like hand cherries but lots of people have told me goes really well together is cherry pie filling and chocolate or devil's food cake.

It definitely helps when the other person is mature and has developed an ability to communicate in a way thats understanding and not attacking. I just hate hurting guys feelings especially when they are really sweet. I think they deserve to be loved and blame myself a bit for lack of physical spark, which leads me to second guess myself. (especially in this instance because there are so many great qualities about him that i want in a partner.) but thats not right to him or me. its definitely better to break things off early than to string someone along when im not ready to truly open up intimitaley.\n\nThanks so much for your response! it helps so much to get the feelings out!",

Randomness is a bit special though, in that it's inherently unpredictable, and so stopping there and saying it\u2019s random helps us determine far less in future predictions. \n\n> Elegance has proven time and time again to be a good barometer of success for various theories. \n\nI agree mostly with this point, though the word of \"elegance\" has a bit of a personal flavor to it. Where yours says that it's more elegant to explain underlying relevance behind the missing other part of the probabilities, mine says that the generation of these entirely new universes seems like a number of extra steps _more_ than just saying there's _one_ or a few hidden variables. \n\n> that means giving up the idea that causes must precede effects...I hope you can see why this is a concerning proposition\n\nI do. Though, I wouldn't dismiss this idea entirely, since I don't understand it, or yours of multiple universes just because of my own lack of comfort in the idea, or lack of imagination. My point though is that time moves forwards - that's how we understand it as a definitively true statement. To say it goes sideways and creates new universes at every new quantum permutation could be just as possible as the fact that it doesn't, again since it isn't falsifiable. And that sideways movement of time is where there's an introduction of another new concept - again to explain something that we observed as randomness, which I would think might have a simpler explanation than the multitude of movements of time.\n\n>That superposition is not just a clever mathematical trick QM plays on us, is instead manifested physically as part of the deep nature of reality that can explain seemingly random measurements?\n\nThat superposition is the current way of explaining the seemingly random measurements. But then it opens the door to more questions, such as why they're random in the first place. Why does randomness exist in the first place? What properties do quantum particles have that cause them to behave randomly, whereas other types of particles don't?\n\nThe main problem that still stands in my mind is also how this relates to other, larger phenomenons as they scale out to bigger and bigger observations that are more clear to us. Like does this randomness occur in nature or life somehow, and if so, what does it affect."

There are no goals in the game or scores, you just have 3 choices. Read someones private concern and offer them uplifting advice or sentiment, vent about your own problems and get thoughtful replies, or just say something general and uplifting that appears in the form of a paper airplane people can click on in their game. It really is a great game, the interactions on there are very different, more honest and heartfelt than many games. \n\nThe fact people will pay 5$ to write something kind to someone else with nothing expected in return shows that there is an unfilled need for this kind of closeness and openness to where people are finding it through other means than church. I think if there were more physical places people could hang out and have fun for free with a kind of focus on acceptance and openness it could fill a big gap for a lot of people."

Don\u2019t give up, but also know that for PTSD In particular, treatment can have varied results.

    "output": "Generally, just moving to CA for school is not sufficient to establish in-state residency for tuition purposes. \n\nTo be considered an in-state student eligible for in-state tuition, the student must:\n\n1. **Maintain physical presence within the state for more than one year**. Physical presence within the state solely for educational purposes  doesn't constitute the establishment of California residence, regardless  of the length of stay.\n2. **Demonstrate intent to become a California resident.** This must be shown through objective documentation that the student's physical presence  was coupled with the intent to make California their permanent home.  Intent is evaluated as an independent element of residence, separate  from physical presence, and is demonstrated by establishing residential  ties in California, and relinquishing ties to the former place of  residence. \n3. **Prove their fiscal independence.** Students under age 24 who are not dependent on a California resident parent also must meet  the university's financial independence requirement in addition to the 366-day physical presence and intent requirements. To be considered fiscally independent, the student (i) must be unmarried, (ii) cannot have been claimed as an income-tax dependent by anyone for the year prior to matriculation, and (iii) must be self-sufficient. Self-sufficiency means the student has supported themself for one full year through the student's own resources (employment wages, loans in student's name only, etc.). \n\nThe practical effect is that it will be very difficulty for your child to obtain in-state tuition unless you move to California *or* your child moves to California *and* your child becomes completely financially independent. \n\nMore information here: [https://www.ucop.edu/residency/faq.html](https://www.ucop.edu/residency/faq.html)"

I gained a lot of weight which made my whole body feel different and most days were just not feeling great. I then made the decision to go and see people. Every day a little. For example I'd ask the supermarket guy where things are despite me knowing full well, just to have that interaction. The city where I live also has a pretty active Reddit community so I asked people there if someone wants to take a stroll. Believe me, the first encounters were so weird.

Useful for, say, a walkie-talkie like application where you everyone you want to talk to is within range of your phone.\n\nThe benefit of a \"mesh\" network is that (A) It doesn't rely solely on a regular radio transmitter, but takes advantage of different, often multiple (ie Firechat) means of communicating with other devices - Wifi, 3g, Bluetooth, etc. A mesh network also (B) allows other devices or nodes to act as middlemen, and the message gets passed along until it ends up in the right location. Unlike with ad-hoc networks, where if Sam can talk to Ben and Ben can talk to Alice, but Sam can **not** talk to Alice, there's no way to communicate between Sam/Alice.

    "output": "From what i've gathered, the scaling/standardising is much harsher in AU.\n\nIn the australian uni I graduated form last year, the assignments were constructed in such a way that the average grade was always around 65. At least in the case of my mathematics degree, they deliberately put in very hard questions so that from a cohort of 100+ students, only a small handful would score above a 90 in any particular test. For example, in an exam of 100 marks, 15 of those might be assigned to very hard questions made to distinguish the top 10 students from the top 5, i.e. it's expected that the vast majority of the cohort won't be able to answer them. \n\nIf the cohort average was too high at the end of the semester, often the final exam would be made much harder to bring the average down, or sometimes the final weighted average mark for that unit would be retroactively scaled to fit the desired bellcurve (usually ~65 average with a standard deviation ~15).\n\nIn my particular uni, the bar for HD (high distinction i.e. 4) was 80% and up, and D (distinction) 70-80%. The 50-70% score-band generally contained over half the cohort. The idea being that as far as academic achievement goes, It's much more important to be able to clearly differentiate those who are extremely good and 'just' very good, than it is to differentiate those who are good enough and just 'good'"

But we've never had multiple choice exams or grades determined by participation so I don't know if that counts towards the grades in the US.",

    "input": "It was an accident - took an Intro to Archaeology class as an elective in undergrad at Florida, fell in love, switched majors.  Went to California, failed to get my MA, went to Texas, got my MA, but couldn't find work and went into education and hated it.\n\nAfter three years of hunting for archaeological/museum jobs while finishing my degree and teaching, I decided I was too unhappy to continue as I had been and widened my net.\n\nI'm now a CAD drafter (thanks to all the GIS/computing/programming/databases classes I took) and so much happier.\n\nArchaeology is a shitshow.  It's racist, clique-y, grad programs celebrate those that squish their classmates on the way to to the top, and ruthlessly exploit everyone for their own gain.  Look at those protests out in California where the grad students were striking for a living wage and 70 of them got fired, some of which now have their visa statuses in jeopardy because of said firings.\n\nIf you still want to do it, get a double-major that will be a safety net at the undergrad level.  GIS (Geographic Information Sciences), programming, computer science, databases, education, business; something versatile that you can use elsewhere.\n\nWhile you're an undergrad, get every internship (museums, archaeological labs, public outreach) that you can, and DO SOMETHING EVERY SUMMER. You will need at least one paid dig (that is, a field school in the summer that you pay a minimum of $2,000 for - mine was over $4,000) on your resume to get into grad school.  \n\nJoin clubs too.  Pad the hell out of your resume.\n\nThen go to grad school.  If you don't get funding, don't go.  You can apply for a PhD right away, or do a MA/MS (depending on the program) and then a PhD. When you're applying to grad school, remember that while programs are important, you're looking for a chair (professor in charge of your career) that you can work with.\n\nGET EVERYTHING IN WRITING.  I did not, and it's a huge reason why I had to leave California empty-handed.\n\nOnce you've found a chair that you can work with, get accepted, and have funding, you need to come up with an original idea (usually a program will \"assign\" you something to start looking at) and do research while taking a full courseload and probably teaching undergrads at the same time.  While in grad school you also need to be in at least one club, preferably as leadership to show your personal progression.\n\nMake sure you stay in regular contact with at least six professors from your education history for letters of recommendation - they can't write them if they don't remember you.  You need to learn how to apply for grants and funding, both for yourself and any projects you want to run for your thesis/dissertation.\n\nBe judicious in choosing which area of the world you want to work in. When I was an undergrad, I met dozens of grad students whose degrees were curtailed or dropped because they couldn't do field work in Egypt/the Middle East because of the Arab Spring.  (Especially the women.) Australian sites and Californian ones were just destroyed this past year in wildfires.  Sites in the midwest are now off limits because the current US government has gutted the Bureau of Land Management.  And archaeological conferences are being canceled as we speak, as well as field schools around the world thanks to coronavirus.\n\nAlso, join at least one professional society - Society of American Archaeology (just had a massive scandal protecting the right of a sexual predator to remain at a conference over the right of his victim to not be harassed), Society for Historical Archaeology, etc etc.  They have conferences at least once a year, you must go (generally you need to pay out of pocket \\[I never paid less than $1,000 between room with roommates, flights, food, fees, etc\\] and sometimes get reimbursed part of it) and present your research every year.  Use this opportunity to network and find people also studying what you're studying, and start forming relationships with the companies who also attend.  There's a massive drinking culture, so make sure you play along, but don't get so drunk people remember you as the drunk one. \n\nIf you have any mental health issues, make sure you take care of those along the way.  I was in therapy for years trying to undo the damage grad school did/was doing to me, and I had to do it in secret because the department made no bones about not wanting \"weak\" students.  I was particularly disliked because I insisted on going to visit my family every Christmas and summer and scheduled my field work around those trips.  I also publicly took off every Saturday night for myself, another huge no-no, and preferred studying in the privacy of my home to the discomfort of the department library.\n\nI had a uniquely awful graduate experience, and I honestly love archaeology more now that I'm not doing it as a career and I can just read about it and glory in what's being done without suffering within the culture as a failure.  Plenty of my classmates would tell you that as long as you work hard and take care of business everything will be great.\n\nBut that wasn't my experience, and I won't lie to make myself sound better - or archaeology, as much as I love the \\*idea\\* of archaeology.",

To be honest most people have this very idealistic image of DCS of being the \"protector\" of children when that is so far from the truth. They are the protector of the laws, many which go against the best interests of children.\n\nIt's funny what you're saying about case managers. I'm very assertive in my role (I genuinely care about these kids) and most workers are taken aback by it because they aren't used to it... They aren't used to having anyone on the team genuinely care and fight for what's best (as opposed to just going through the motions and paperwork and leaving things as they are). This job has given me a lot of exposure to the bureaucracy that is child welfare.\n\nHope you are doing well now.... I always wonder why my kids' futures are going to look like. I can only hope that what I'm doing now improves things for them even just a little bit.",
    "output": "Your exactly right about the public's view of of DCS, that's why I speak about it every chance I get. If nobody talks about it, nothing will ever change. Even it's a thread on reddit, you never know who might see it. Someone once told me ALL foster parents are great people and heroes, I just nicely reminder her there is good and bad in everything. People are naive to the truth, I think DCS started with good intentions but to put it simply they are too big for their own britches and stuck in politics.  That is exactly what I saw in DCS, just push the paperwork through. I dont think a majority of social workers (sadly) care about the best interest of the child. Everyone needs a job. I really did see a lot more than most in the system, I am not just bias! Like I said I became friends with my caseworker, really good friends. Well I also knew the judge, went to school with her daughters, I had a guardian ad litam that would walk through fire for me. My last foster parents, my foster dad was an attorney who knew the family court very well. I also know other people that work there. Anyway, my point with that is I'm not bias, it's a damn bureaucracy. \nHaving a caseworker with compassion, that cares DOES matter to a kid, whether they show it or not. My last caseworker and my guardian ad litam were the only two people in DCS that went out of their way to help me.   Thank you for your concern. I am doing well know, I'm 31 and I just got my business license and due to covid I have to wait for my permit. I've been doing good for about 9 years now, after a run with drugs and prostitution. Where sadly, I think most foster kids end up in the same situation i did after they are 18, LOST and ALONE. I'm great now though. I'm sure what you are doing for the kids, matters to them...even if they dont know it now.  Even if you dont continue to work in DCS please never stop being a voice for the children."

Second, I'm asthmatic and my parents smoked 4-5 packs a day between the two of them when I was a kid.  I was in the hospital overnight or longer due to my asthma 4 times as a kid and it only started getting under control when I moved out and got away from the smoke.  Something like 17% of asthmatics smoke and this baffles me.  Smoking doesn't cause asthma, but if you have asthma it triggers flare-ups and if you are doing it like a chain smoker you are willfully causing those attacks.  I'm completely incapable of reconciling this constant state of shortness of breath being a choice and a mask being impossible.\n\nHonestly though, I don't think she has it.  It's not a super uncommon disease...particularly in children...but I feel like the number of people self-identifying as asthmatics has legitimately gone up over the last couple of months because it's the one that most people think would actually be worsened by a mask.",

I mentioned two vague ones in my last post.\n\nI\u2019m shy so it\u2019d be hard for me to do something like that, but I definitely remember wanting to do it when I was younger just so I could fit in. I do know more extroverted people who have done sexual activities with people they weren\u2019t attracted to. Young people are always worried about fitting in. For example, if you\u2019re a closeted gay person growing up, you\u2019re expected to be pursuing the opposite gender. That\u2019s just what you\u2019re expected to do. And if you grew up in a family or a school like mine, there was tremendous pressure to be that way. Anything else brings shame, anger, and mocking. Many people fall for that pressure and try to live straight lives at first. Most end up failing and eventually come to terms with their sexuality, but a few continue to do this well into adulthood.\n\n>As far as gay guys living a straight life\u2026..are they lying to their straight partner?\n\nSome are. But I think some are just so in denial that they convince themselves they\u2019re straight even though they\u2019re not. This is especially common among very religious people. Never underestimate the power of denial.\n\nBtw you can find a lot of stories about this on YouTube. It sounds ridiculous but it does happen"

    "input": "I'm in my early 60s, been swimming frequently in rivers and lakes and oceans since I was 5 or 6. The first thing I want to know where ever I travel is \"where is the water\"? I got stung by a jellyfish one time in all of that and that is the only thing that ever took a swipe at me and landed and probably because I stepped on it (got me in the foot when I was a kid). Oh, and I've been nipped by crabs a few times, I guess you could count that.\n\nWe are getting ready to go to Hawaii in about a year and I am SO excited, just so excited, and I won't be in hotels or going to buy hats or whatever, I'll be in the water 90% of the time, it's what I care about. Waterfalls too, I hope I get to be in some waterfalls.\n\nEven piranha are not going to launch themselves at you unless you are openly bleeding (they're attracted to blood) or have open wounds. Snakes and reptiles in general don't bother me either, don't fuck with them they won't fuck with you. I do wear good boots if I'm in a place they're known to frequent and keep my eyes and ears open, you have to use common sense with nature. It *can* be deadly, but never was for me or countless others who use common sense and understand (do research) on the area they are entering, whether on land or in the water.\n\nI've seen so many amazing things: When I was around 12 I was in the ocean on a raft and a school of manta rays swam underneath me, I stuck my hand in and ran it along the backs of a few. A little older and I was in a boat and we anchored and I dove in and a couple of dolphins swam up and started playing with me, swimming around me, and when I climbed back up the ladder chittered at me before we left, like they were saying goodbye. I went scuba diving in a dark lake and saw this HUGE catfish about 70 feet down that was trapped in a cave. Just hanging there with it's mouth open to catch the unwary fish that swam in there. In Alaska we were on a boat and I made eye contact from about 3 feet away with this beautiful seal. The eyes, I remember that, so beautiful. I was near the everglades, flew in to visit my bestie who lived in a trailer in the middle of a swamp and saw an anaconda crawl across her front lawn and across her driveway and spanned the entire driveway with plenty of snake to either side, it was HUGE. My bestie was like, \"Oh that's just George, we see him sometimes when he's out hunting\". I had never before, and have never since, seen a snake that big in person, it was incredible.\n\nThose are just the highlights. All these experiences, all the feelings they evoked, I would have missed if I was afraid of fish in the water. Sometimes to do a thing I've had to set aside a fear of death (cliff diving into water would be one of those) and ask myself whether or not this thing I want to do is worth it? It's always been worth it.\n\nI get that we are all different and unique but it is hard for me sometimes to relate to people that are afraid of natural water and what it contains. It's life for us on this planet, and contains life. I celebrate that and would not have missed one second of my experiences, including the jellyfish sting.  \n\nEveryone should learn to swim imo, all children should be taught to swim because you never know what life will throw at you and being able to survive water is crucial. Too many people drown, so many lives and so much talent and all their gifts to the world gone, without this simple skill.\n\nSometimes, if you are afraid of a thing, the best thing to do is do that thing anyway because if you want life changing experiences that is how you get life changing experiences. The fish are waiting for you, get out there!\n\n /end old nana rant",
    "output": "Oh absolutely! For some reason the ocean I am absolutely fine to swim in. I like in MN and obviously there is a ton of lakes, most I'm fine with but some have snapping turtles and fish that are a bit more curious!

It made sense to get the offer from them, that way \"making a payment\" is as easy as transferring money from my checking to the debt and I can monitor spending/saving in one place. \n\nThe 0% interest for X months was an introductory offer and all other purchases have a \"low\" interest rate of maybe 10-15% which I don't use it for. I only use it for balance transfers and there is the fee... But again, a 2-3% fee is better than 15-25% apr. I've primarily seen the 0% interest for 12-20 months. I've had it for about 2-3 years and I'm on my second interest free balance transfer. I was offered a third I didn't need at the time so it does come up even though it's not regularly available.\n\nIn a sense this can be used to self-consolidate instead of going through a company that could offer a flat percentage apr for consolidation. More control over it and probably a better deal."

However, you can't say that veganism is more important than medical guidelines from professionals because that's just not true.

    "output": "Learning new songs at this point may be tough due to issues with short term memory, but it's still possible and easier than the alternative of trying to do speech on the spot. Using a sound board involves cognitive decision making from the problem solving area of your brain to remember what button does what. Different area than speech, but also could be negatively impacted by memory degradation within the brain. It would vary depending on the illness and severity. Not an awful idea though. Hell, even dogs are using sound board to communicate now. The birch about the whole thing is getting past the hurdle of having to remember things you can do, without having to think about remembering them or that you can learn to remember them. A lot of gray areas, and a lot of obstacles, but definitely all within the realm of reasonability with work and practice, and most importantly with hope and patience."

From a situation where her employer may have failed to keep her safe from a predatory employee (I wonder if they have security cameras on their facilities).  That predator still roams free to rape other victims. \n\n2. His wife was unfaithful. Got pregnant. She hoped beyond hope that her spouse was the father.  When it obviously was not, she took the most sympathetic stance she could and claimed rape. \n\nNow OP is in a position where he has to decide choose between the lack of trust his partner has in him and to believe she had a traumatic experience that he was somehow oblivious to and sheltered from.... OR... that his partner was unfaithful to him, accidentally got pregnant, and decided to wait and see what happened. \n\nOP very clearly WANTS to be a father, so he is making the best of the situation... \n\nWhat will his wife think, every time she looks at this child, if she does not deal with the suspected trauma. \n\nYes. We should believe victims when they come forward. That does not mean we do it without detail or insight, because humans have been known to manipulate or hide the truth.  \n\nOP, you are a good man.

The blame for that falls squarely on the venue(s)!\n\nLast summer my town (think smaller population majority LDS community) actually had the Rockzilla tour come through. Papa Roach, Hollywood Undead, Falling in Reverse, and Bad Wolves. We all got there before gates were to open because it was sold out. 8,000+ tickets. Gates to open at 5. 6:30 comes and we're still all waiting in line in 95+\u00b0 weather. Come to find out the security they had hired for the event never showed, and they had NO EMT'S or medical people on site, no ambulances, no nothing. A front man for one of the bands (he's been in the news quite a bit lately for band's leaving his other tour) refused to let **ANYONE** go out onstage until they re-did the way the pit was set up, and got EMT's, medical personel and ambulances on site, and more security. He said that it was a risk to the fans that he wasn't willing to take. Lots of people called him a Diva for it, but I think it was the absolute right call to make. \n\nThis venue has LOTS of problems when it comes to security, seating, (a friend of mine has been sold tickets to seats that don't exsist 3 concerts in a row) medical staff, the whole shebang! It's also an outdoor venue with NO SHADE OR SHELTER other than the bathrooms.  The problem is it's the only venue our town has, and until last year, the only venue within 4hours in our state. \n\nLike I mentioned earlier, our town has a high concentration of LDS community. We rarely get rock or metal concerts here. We usually have to drive 4hrs to another non-LDS town in our state or 3hrs to another state to see good concerts.",

What they'd do is take a bunch of bands that were on Ozzfest and bring them out to our state for a night. Somewhere between 13-15 bands on 3 stages. Those were killer!! Got to see Static X before Wayne died. \n\nBack in 2010 and a few years following, Rockstar used to do a Rockstar Mayhem festival every year. 15 bands, 3 stages. Those were amazing too!! One year both Korn and Rob Zombie were selling their CD's for $15 and if you bought the CD, you got to meet the band and get it autographed. I bought Korn's and got to get it signed, and my husband bought Rob Zombie's. \n\nThe \"fests\" they do now, like Rockzilla and even Knotfest (which I've gone to twice) are only like 4 bands. Which, of course I'm not complaining at all, but when you go from festivals of 15 bands and 3 stages to 4 bands and 1, it's a BIG DIFFERENCE.

You have no idea how much it means to hear someone say these things to me, because guilt is rough; my late husband, ironically, always said that guilt is a waste of time; if an apology is needed, make one, and if one isn't warranted,  then just forgive yourself. Because of my upbringing, I always had guilt for things that weren't my fault, and that was always a heavy burden but he helped me see that most of the things I felt guilt for weren't even my fault to begin with. That probably doesn't make sense unless you were raised with an abusive parent. I know he understood completely why I couldn't bring myself to do that for him, and he never intended for me to feel guilt, but I can't help but feel as if I let him down. I know he definitely didn't want me to get in trouble,  and I very well could have; all it would have taken was one arrogant person with the power to do so. I am working through it but I probably should talk to someone. It's the only thing I question about having cared for him at home for a year when he contracted ALS, and I hate that it spoils what was otherwise a most loving, caring experience that I would gladly do for the rest of my life, if only he didn't have to suffer.

Parents tried their best. Never really got along with my brother for some reason.\n\nI didn\u2019t have many friends. I was always looked as the weird kid in school. 12 was when this really hit me and that\u2019s when I started thinking that maybe life would be better if I were dead. I went to a high school where no one knew me and somehow I managed to make lots of friends. For the first time in my life I had real friends but those dark thoughts were still there. I don\u2019t know why but I acted out and never went to class. I started drinking and smoking weed. Still managed to graduate on time but it wasn\u2019t easy.\n\nCollege was wild. I started going to raves and that\u2019s where I discovered MDMA. I became addicted to that and was also drinking heavily, sometimes 5-6 nights a week. Also started taking other drugs such as coke, speed, LSD, shrooms. It was mainly because it felt so good to not be sober. I became addicted to MDMA and was going to a rave a week. I lost a ton of weight (and I was pretty skinny in the first place). I got dismissed from college due to having such a low GPA and that was my wake up call.\n\nI went to a community college, and then graduated and got my bachelor\u2019s. Took 7 years in total. Don\u2019t really take drugs anymore besides alcohol. Got a job in an industry that was destroyed by COVID. Now I\u2019m starting fresh in a completely new field and not doing so well. My depression just seems to be getting worse. I feel fine for a week maybe and then the next week I\u2019m back in this suicidal mindstate.\n\nI think I can safely say that it\u2019s not what\u2019s happening in my life that causes me to feel this way- it sure doesn\u2019t help but I think it\u2019s the way my brain is wired. I was born like this I think. Life can be going very well and I\u2019ll still be absolutely miserable. I used to think \u201cif I get this job\u201d or \u201cif I get a girlfriend I\u2019ll be much happier\u201d but when those things happened I still felt like shit. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s all the drugs. I was heavily abusing MDMA for about 3 years and it\u2019s long-term effects on the brain are not widely known. But I remember back when I was a teenager and I didn\u2019t do anything (before I even smoked weed or drank) I would be wildly crippled with depression. It would be so difficult to get out of bed. I don\u2019t know. I think therapy (and maybe medication) might be the only thing that helps. I exercise (when I\u2019m not in one of my bad states) and eat healthy. It hasn\u2019t helped honestly.",
    "output": "Another thing... I think you might need to explore further into your memories to see what may have happened maybe in the past if you recall nothing. \n\n\nOr It could just be a chemical imbalance during teenage and if you maybe powered thru it without drugs it would have passed and with drugs it just got more and more exaggerated as you didn't deal with your feeling and just shoved them under with drugs. \n\n\nMaybe look into CBT or write journals daily to see what brings the bouts of depression."

I look at it as another source of income, and just like I wouldn't stop working because of those things you've mentioned, I wouldn't stop investing.\n\nInvesting is not that hard actually, it's only scary at first because the negative press that tend to dominate the news (I've concluded American media loves to fear-monger, so I tend to ignore most news outlets); also people tend to conflate investing with trading, which is another beast altogether.\n\nTouching on the student-loan problem specifically: I would love to see people give up on the big institutions and go to local colleges instead, which are far more affordable. In many carrier paths, where you went to school doesn't matter as much in the long run, experience takes precedence. Perhaps a boycott on the big institutions will lead to some reform. I'm glad I took this approach and got out of school with nominal debt. It was mostly out of necessity and it's the best thing that could have happened in hindsight. I couldn't afford the prestigious unis, and I refused to take on massive debt, so I worked my way through a community college and eventually through a local uni (that suspended me for a semester because I couldn't pay tuition btw, and then had the nerve to ask me for alumni contribution \ud83d\ude02).\n\n> Just lucky they haven't made it generational debt yet.\n\nThis is scary and I hope it never comes to pass. Financial bondage is the new slavery, and it is systemic, and is only getting worse.",
    "output": "I know what you mean about the fear-mongering. Whatever punches buttons and gets views, right? I listen to AP and NPR, not the big left and right wing stuff...Fox News, Breightbart(?), MSNBC, CNN. Plus they have more International stuff, you really don't get that with most American News programs. Oh wait-yes, CBS. Love them. My grandparents watched CBS. And they weren't wrong. Totally miss Walter Cronkite. \n\nYou are very lucky on the student loan thing. I think you are right though. It is the Administration that is getting all that money. The teachers, unless they have tenure, aren't seeing any of it. \n\nGenerational scares the crap out of me. I think maybe we need to get our son to change his name and move out of our house. He has the same first and last name and address as my husband right now. And I am afraid they will mistake them for each other and nail the elder's debts to the younger. \n\nThey already did this terrifying step toward it during the Obama administration. If you are the spouse of someone who owes a student loan, and you are legally married, then you are responsible to pay that loan. This is even if you never co-signed it. And even if you get divorced from that person, you still owe the money the same way that they do, unable to get a bankruptcy, etc. Just as if you had taken the loan out yourself. \n\nI have had so many people at the Dept. of Children and Family to give me the advice to divorce my husband so I can get out from under his student loans. I am disabled, and wouldn't be able to pay them back anyway, but now they can garnish MY social security disability payments, because I am married to him.  \n\nAnd the investing thing? I am scared of that  because they have supposedly done away with the protections that were in place from the 30's era. That financial advisors had to have a fiduciary level of care. Now every thing that has investing on it is no longer backed by FDIC. And even on your 401K, (the whole thing!) they can lose it all, money that you sent your whole working life saving up. Because it isn't insured by the FDIC. And there is no recourse!! At least if you take that money and put it in a savings account, it won't make anything, but you can't LOSE it all.  But the businesses won't give you the choice to do that. \n\nHere, you can't even choose what company to save your 401K through. You have to go with whomever is the cheapest for the employer to work with. And they change them more often than their underwear! And now the companies are \"phasing out\" HR departments, which were the people that helped everyone make sure they were signed up for 401k's and healthcare. Now the Manager is responsible for that on top of everything else and if they miss the window? You can go without healthcare for a year!! \n\nMy husband has been with the same company  for over 12 years now, and the same 1500$ that he has had since he started working there is still the same in his 401K. He loses and gains little every year, just enough that it is still the same. It frustrates me because I think that if we knew how to work the system, we coould get it to make some money. And if we knew how to invest, we might be able to make enough through there to payoff the student loans. But we just don't know how to make it work!"

I think it\u2019s really interesting to hear where/why you slowly began to question what had, up to that point, been your entire life and I\u2019ve not experienced being raised religiously as my parents are both christened but don\u2019t necessarily believe in god and decided to leave it for me and my sister to decide if we wanted to be christened or not.\n\nA while back I was talking to my friend who is a Catholic about her beliefs and she\u2019s one of a handful of people that I know that believe in god and we were having a conversation about science and stuff and she said she had begun to question her faith because of what I had been telling her and that she had never looked at it a different way because of her upbringing.\n\nI don\u2019t know how you identify but if you have told your parents how did they react being as religious as they are? I haven\u2019t come out and I like to think my parents won\u2019t be bothered by it as we have gay relatives but just wondering how you experience was.",
    "output": "I identify as mostly straight lol. I realized that while I find women to be sexy, it\u2019s just lust. I\u2019ve never been in love with a woman, and I find men to be much more emotionally fulfilling. I\u2019ve told my mom and my sister about all this, but there\u2019s honestly no point in telling my dad, since really it has no effect on the way I live my life, and he\u2019s definitely the most conservative one in the family."

He asked me on a date and we ended up going out for drinks.\n\nHe was a physics professor at a university that I attended. During our date he was going on and on and on about the magic of water bottles, because they can hold water. He put on a bit of a magic show for me and was explaining why it was so remarkable that humans had engineered bottles to contain water. It was an awkward date. I was young and he wanted to come back to my place. He had spent money on drinks for me so I felt obligated to say yes. \n\nWe went back to my house and started being intimate. Things (rather quickly) progressed to sex. He just kept saying, \u201cIT\u2019S MAGIC! \u201cIT\u2019S MAGIC\u201d\u2026 this dude grabs a bottle of water and it\u2019s probably half full. He is on top of me and he takes a sip and then he says, \u201cdo you want to see some magic?\u201d and I said \u201cno\u201d. He then proceeded to pour the bottle of water ALL OVER ME and my bed.\n\nI immediately disengaged and he asked me, \u201ccan\u2019t you finish me off?\u201d. I told him to finish himself off and leave. The other thing about this guy was that his moans sounded exactly like the Mandrake plants in Harry Potter. My roommate at the time heard everything and proceeded to call him \u201cMandrake\u201d. \n\nUnfortunately I had to see him again because he lived with two of my good friends but it was extremely awkward and it made me think twice about sleeping with someone who lived with my good friends. It was a very strange experience. I still have no idea why he poured water all over me."
