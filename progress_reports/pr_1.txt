Progress Report - 2025-04-27 to 2025-04-28

Summary:
Today was a MAJOR milestone in the Ascent project.

What We Accomplished:
- Added a massive amount of new conversations to expand Ascentâ€™s dataset.
- Implemented major upgrades to the model architecture, including multi-head attention and better vocab handling.
- Improved training output formatting: added a progress bar, estimated training time, and cleaner epoch updates.
- Reorganized the control center (hyperparameters and toggles) for easier adjustments without touching the core code.
- Handled invalid probability fallbacks more gracefully with a friendly counter instead of messy spam.
- Built a fully working dashboard that now displays saved PNG graphs of loss and perplexity curves (HUGE quality-of-life upgrade).
- Organized metadata saving and created a new folder structure for training logs and progress reports.

Challenges We Faced:
- Model outputs sometimes still had early sentence cutoffs ("cheating" to end fast).
- Needed multiple retries to fix the dashboard graph displays and data sorting.
- Training now pushes the computer pretty hard (watching temps is important).
- Still need deeper improvements to sampling quality (refining p-sampling and fallback handling further).

Overall Reflection:
The language structure Ascent is producing is getting better and better. The sense of flow, metaphor, and grounding is visible now even with occasional weirdness. We're at a tipping point where future improvements will be about QUALITY of data and sampling, not just size of the dataset.

Next Steps:
- Further polish the sampling and fallback behavior.
- Grow the dataset carefully to emphasize *meaningful* sentence structure.
- Lightly explore model expansion (future: hidden size? more transformer layers?).
- Keep documenting each phase of growth in the new progress_reports folder!

ðŸŒ± Ascent is slowly but surely becoming something truly beautiful.
