# Ascent 1.0 üöÄ

Welcome to **Ascent** ‚Äî a personal, lightweight LLM project designed for language experimentation, personal growth, and building an understanding of AI systems from the ground up.

## üåü Project Highlights
- **Custom Model:** Built and trained from scratch using PyTorch.
- **Transformer Architecture:** Simple yet powerful self-attention mechanism.
- **Training Dashboard:** Live tracking of loss, perplexity, and progress bars.
- **Conversation Mode:** Chat with your model right inside the terminal.
- **Dataset Expansion:** Easily grow the model's conversational abilities.
- **Training Logs:** Save loss curves, perplexity curves, and run metadata for every session.

## üöÄ Features
- Vocabulary dynamically grows with the dataset.
- Save and reload best-performing models automatically.
- Easy "Control Center" settings to tweak model size, training epochs, batch size, etc.
- Loading bar with estimated time remaining during training.
- Fall-back counter to monitor token generation stability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- Python 3
- PyTorch
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## ‚öôÔ∏è Quick Start

Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/codycherrington/Ascent-1.0.git
```

Install required packages:
```
pip install torch pandas matplotlib
```

Run the project:
```
python model.py
```

Optional: Launch the dashboard separately:
```
python dashboard.py
```

## üß† Goals of Ascent
- Learn foundational AI architecture concepts by building hands-on (and with the help of AI tools).
- Create a meaningful companion that improves over time.
- Serve as a flexible skeleton for future projects (trading bots, medical advisors, etc.)
