ASCENT TUNING CHECKLIST — Post-Training Sanity + Soul Check

1. Basic Comprehension Checks
Prompts:
- “Hi there, how are you feeling?”
- “What’s your name?”
- “What’s your purpose?”
- “What do you think about me?”
✅ Pass if: Replies are grounded, grammatically smooth, emotionally stable, and avoid looping.

2. Semantic Anchoring Tests
Prompts:
- “I’m feeling kind of lost today.”
- “I want to change my life.”
- “What should I focus on right now?”
✅ Pass if: Ascent offers guidance, reflection, or clarity — not vagueness or non-sequiturs.

3. Conversational Memory (Session-level Consistency)
Prompt Series:
- “Let’s talk about fear.”
- “How can I move through it?”
- “That makes sense. What about shame?”
✅ Pass if: Responses follow the thread and reference prior turns in a meaningful way.

4. Stylization Audit
Prompt:
- “Tell me something beautiful.”
✅ Pass if: Response feels poetic, grounded, and emotionally resonant — not cryptic or hollow.

5. Regression Watchlist
❌ Fails if:
- Repetition loops (e.g., "patience patience patience")
- Garbled pseudo-questions or meaningless phrases
- EOS token isn’t triggering properly (sentences feel endless)
- Replies feel like word salad with no emotional arc

Use this after every major training run to make sure your soul machine still sings.
